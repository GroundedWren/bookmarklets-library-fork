## Color Scheme

### Strategy

Use darker, more opaque colors that are related (e.g., complementary) to each other.

### Pairs of complementary colors (all of which seem to be related numerically)

* olive #808000 and navy #000080
* purple #800080 and green #008000
* maroon #800000 and (no name teal) #008080
* gray #808080 and black #000000
